# DS-Capstone--IBM

This is the final capstone project associated with the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

In this project, we determined if SpaceX will reuse the first stage. Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, we trained a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage.

We gathered the data from the SpaceX REST API and used data science techniques to perform data preparation, data analysis, and prediction.

We analyzed the data and identified insights and trends that include the following:
 1. We analyzed the successful launch rate for each location
 2. We explored the location features (proximities) of launch locations
 3. We discovered the relationships between successful launch rate and other parameters for launch locations
